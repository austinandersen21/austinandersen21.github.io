## Hi welcome to my portfolio

My name is Austin Andersen, I am 21 years old and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from Boise State University. I am about 2/3 of the way through my degree and I expect to graduate in 2024.

### A little about me

I enjoy playing Video Games, hanging out with my friends and family, skiing, and mountain biking. I live with Tasha, my girlfriend of two years and we have a 1 year old son together. His name is Noah and he is the cutest little kid you can imagine

### Current projects
